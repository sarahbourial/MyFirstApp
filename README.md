# MyFirstApp
In this project I moved from client-side development (using HTML, CSS and JS) to building a server-side web application using the Express.js web framework hosted in Node.js runtime environment. The site includes a flatty style landing page including navigatation bar, sign-up forms, staff info etc. It has an uncluttered and minimal UI. The backend APIâ€™s communicated with databases designed using MongoDB, an example of a NoSQL database program using JSON-like objects with schemas. All APIs, including GET, PUT, UPDATE and DELETE were tested using Postman. Great experience using PuTTY open-source terminal emulator, working remotely over SSH network protocol.
